On this screen, you can 'design' the [Console Action Buttons](./ConsoleActionButtons.md) by assigning visual attributes and [Actions](./TriggerActions.md) to Buttons arranged on a grid.

The general usage of this screen is similar to that for configuring [Versatile Buttons](./ConsoleVButtons.md), except that an [Actions](./TriggerActions.md) needs to be assigned to a button.
