[![Up](img/goup.gif)](./Settings.md)

This Settings screen allows configuration of function buttons which will be shown on the [Console](./Console.md) screen.

The screenshot above is an example layout. Initially, the *Button Settings* area is empty.

## Button Layout

Buttons on the [Console](./Console.md) screen are arranged in an N x M grid where the *Number of Rows* and *Number of Columns* can be configured.   

Once non-zero values have been specified and submitted, the *Buttons Settings* area will show a list of parameters for specification of button properties.

If an existing grid layout is modified by changing either the number of rows and/or the number of columns, the configured rows and columns of buttons will be preserved if the new values are larger than the old ones. Superfluous rows or columns will be removed in case that new dimensions are smaller than the old ones.

**IMPORTANT**: You need to [Store Configuration](./SettingsConfiguration.md) if you want the button settings to survive a server restart!
