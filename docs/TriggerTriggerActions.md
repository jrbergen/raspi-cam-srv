On this page, you specify which actions are invoked in case of a specific Trigger event.

**IMPORTANT**: To preserve any configurations over server restart, you need to [store the configuration and activate *Start Server with stored Configuration*](./SettingsConfiguration.md)


The dialog will only allow changes when the event handling thread is not active.

Just activate the check box for every event you want to be triggered by a specific trigger.
